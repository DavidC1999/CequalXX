# C=++

C=++ is the sequal to C=

What do I want to do here:
- Use C++ for development to make my life easier and hopefully develop the language faster than C=
- Better Windows support by using CMake as a build system
- Add type checking
- Compile to bytecode which can be interpreted (Maybe JVM support if I feel like it?)
- Something that might look a little bit like object oriented programming at some point?
